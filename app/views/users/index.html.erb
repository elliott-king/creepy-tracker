        <p class="lead">As you browse the web, you leave an identifiable mark. Even with a content blocker, it may be possible to uniquely identify you.</p>
        <p>This webpage cannot access your search history, or see anything outside of its browser environment. However, it can interpret a few things just by looking at this environment. For example, it can look at your installed plugins and fonts, as well as the page dimensions, and combine them into a semi-unique fingerprint.</p>
